Snake Game using Python Turtle

This game is a simple version of the classic Snake game.
It was created for Cambourne Young Techies - Tech Club students to learn about:
- Basic Python programming
- Turtle graphics
- Handling keyboard events
- Game loops and logic

How it works:
- The snake moves around the screen, growing when it eats food.
- The player controls the snake using the arrow keys.
- The game resets if the snake crashes into itself.
- The snake wraps around if it goes off the screen.

Controls:
- Up arrow:    Move up
- Down arrow:  Move down
- Left arrow:  Move left
- Right arrow: Move right

Install:
Install turtle and random modules, if you donâ€™t have it already installed, open your cmd and type in the following command.
>pip install turtle
>pip install random2
